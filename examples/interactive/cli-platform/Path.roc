## There are two types of paths:
## * _Canonical_ paths have the type `Path [Canonical]`. They are absolute paths (so, no ".." or "." path components) and have all symlinks resolved.
## * _Raw_ paths have the type `Path [Raw]`. They come from Roc strings. They may be absolute or relative, they may contain symlinks, and the operating system may not consider them syntactically valid paths.
##
## A [Path] can be either of these, depending on its type parameter. For convenience,
## there are the type aliases `RawPath : Path [Raw]` and `CanPath : Path [Canonical]`.
##
## File operations (such as reading from a file) will typically accept either type of [Path],
## but some operations in this module work differently with one or the other. For example,
## [rootRaw] sometimes returns `None` because the path might be relative, whereas [rootCan]
## always returns a root because it's guaranteed to be an absolute path, which must have a root.
##
## You can get a [RawPath] from a [Str] using [Path.fromStr], and you can convert it to
## a canonical path using [Path.canonicalize].
##
## Note that comparing canonical paths is typically more reliable than comparing raw ones.
## For example, `Path.fromStr "foo/bar/../baz" == Path.fromStr "foo/baz"` will return `False`,
## because those are different [RawPath]s even though they would [canonicalize] to the same
## [CanPath]s.
##
## Also note that canonicalization reads from the file system (in order to resolve symbolic
## links, and to convert relative paths into absolute ones). This means that it is not only
## a [Task] (which can fail), but also that running [canonicalize] on the same [Path] twice
## may give different answers. An example of a way this could happen is if a symbolic link
## in the path changed on disk to point somewhere else in between the two [canonicalize] calls.
##
## Similarly, remember that canonical paths are not guaranteed to refer to a valid file. They
## might have referred to one when they were canonicalized, but that file may have moved or
## been deleted since the canonical path was created. So you might [canonicalize] a [Path],
## and then immediately use that [Path] to read a file from disk, and still get back an error
## because something relevant changed on the filesystem between the two operations.

    # We store these separately for two reasons:
    # 1. If I'm calling an OS API, passing a path I got from the OS is definitely safe.
    #    However, passing a Path I got from a RocStr might be unsafe; it may contain \0
    #    characters, which would result in the operation happening on a totally different
    #    path. As such, we need to check for \0s and fail without calling the OS API if we
    #    find one in the path.
    # 2. If I'm converting the Path to a Str, doing that conversion on a Path that was
    #    created from a RocStr needs no further processing. However, if it came from the OS,
    #    then we need to know what charset to assume it had, in order to decode it properly.

# it has no \0 characters.

## Note that canonicalization reads from the file system (in order to resolve symbolic
## links, and to convert relative paths into absolute ones). This means that it is not only
## a [Task] (which can fail), but also that running [canonicalize] on the same [Path] twice
## may give different answers. An example of a way this could happen is if a symbolic link
## in the path changed on disk to point somewhere else in between the two [canonicalize] calls.
##
## Returns an effect type of `[Metadata, Cwd]` because it can resolve symbolic links
## and can access the current working directory by turning a relative path into an
## absolute one (which can prepend the absolute path of the current working directory to
## the relative path).

## Assumes the given [Path] is encoded in the given [Charset], and attempts to decode
## it as such. This decoding can fail if the [Path] is not in the given [Charset].
##
## Unfortunately, operating system paths do not include information about which charset
## they were originally encoded with. It's most common (but not guaranteed) that they will
## have been encoded with the same charset as the operating system's curent locale (which
## typically does not change after it is set during installation of the OS), so
## [Locale.displayPath] should convert a [Path] to a valid string as long as the path
## was created in the given [Locale]. (Use [Env.locale] to get the current locale.)
